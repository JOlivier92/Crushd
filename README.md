# Crush'd

### Crush'd

Crush'd is an online dating application like no other. Users can go on Crush'd and create a short introduction video...'like' and instant message each other, and spark a love connection.

## Background and Overview

* Introduce yourself in a short video and ask potential mates a question you would really like to know. 
* Crush'd algorithim matches you with other users who can video record a reply to your question. 
* If you like how they answered, a match is made and you can message each other and take it from there. :heart:

* Real-time: Communication feels instantaneous. More generally, updates to the state of an application in multiple locations occur with no perceptible delay.
* Seamless: Users can expect a responsive application that is intuitive to use and has a consistent look and feel regardless of the platform.

Crush'd is primarily built with the MERN stack, a combination of following four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

We will need to:

* Build a database to store user and browsing data such as videos, 'likes' and 'dis-likes'.
* Construct a web application with interactive web page to browse user profiles and videos.
* Build a messenger feature that allows users who have liked each other to interact in real time.
